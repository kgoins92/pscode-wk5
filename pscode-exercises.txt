// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Define values
x = 4, y = 9

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Check to see if the number is even.
If x / %2 = 0, return "even"
  else x /%2 !=0, return "odd"

If y / %2 = 0, return "even"
  else y /%2 !=0, return "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Define 5 numbers.
read x1, x2, x3, x4, x5

Calculate average of 5 numbers
avg = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)/5

find min
if (x1 > x2) set min to x1
  else min max to x2
if (max < x3) set min to x3
  else min remains
if (max < x4) set min to x4
  else min remains
if (max < x5) set min to x5
  else min remains

find max
if (x1 > x2) set max to x1
  else set max to x2
if (max < x3) set max to x3
  else max remains
if (max < x4) set max to x4
  else max remains
if (max < x5) set max to x5
  else max remains

Results from b is adding 5 numbers together, and dividing by the quantity, which calculates the average, and is defined as avg.
Results from c would be setting a value to the min or max, and then using the operator greater or less than to change the definition of the max, if the statement is true, otherwise, it remains the same.
